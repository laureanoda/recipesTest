### Summary: This is a sample app with a custom async imageLoader
### Focus Areas: the imageLoader, usage of async await across the board, viewmodels + providers
### Time spent: around 10 hours
### Trade-Offs: not using the already included AsyncImage from SwiftUI, too many libraries out there with better performance options
### Weakest Part: unit tests can be improved, not using publishers for networking
